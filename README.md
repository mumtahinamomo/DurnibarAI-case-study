## 2. Problem Statement

Modern fitness enthusiasts often juggle multiple applications:
- One for workouts
- Another for nutrition
- Separate trackers for sleep, hydration, and recovery

This fragmentation:
- Disrupts user consistency
- Ignores individual recovery needs

- Lacks sustained motivation mechanisms

The result: even motivated users lose engagement within weeks.
