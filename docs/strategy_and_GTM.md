# Strategy & GTM

## Target Beachhead
Students/early-career users who want simplest habit loop; channels: campus groups, Discords, micro-influencers.

## Positioning
“Track less, stick more.” 
Recovery-aware planning with cultural food inclusivity and fastest log.

## Adoption Loops
- **Acquisition**: referral after 7-day streak → share card.
- **Activation**: 60s guided setup → first plan + first log.
- **Retention**: streaks, weekly progress digest, “nudge only when helpful.”

## Monetization Hypothesis (later)
Freemium; Pro for advanced plans, export, and coach features.
