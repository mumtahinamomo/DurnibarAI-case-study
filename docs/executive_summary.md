# Executive Summary (Durnibar)

**Problem**: Fitness tracking is fragmented across workout, nutrition, sleep, and recovery tools resulting in low consistency and drop-off.

**Solution**: Unified tracker with AI planning, cultural inclusive nutrition tracker, and motivation loops.

**Primary Users**: College students & early career professionals who want simple logging and recovery aware plans.

**Differentiation**: Recovery aware AI plans and culturally inclusive food database with minimal taps to log.

**North Star Metric (NSM)**: Weekly Consistent Trackers (WCT) - % of weekly active users who log on ≥3 distinct days/week.

**Guardrails**: 
(1) Time-to-log median ≤ 20s
(2) Churn D30 ≤ 35%
(3) Complaint rate about food DB ≤ 3%

**Targets**: 
30-day: WCT 25% → 35%
90-day: 45% (assumes simplified logging and streak nudges).

**Release Plan**: v0 fake-door → v1 log + plan → v1.1 streaks → v1.2 nutrition.
