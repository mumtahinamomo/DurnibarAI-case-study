> **Note on the Prototype PDF:**  
> The included prototype PDF references the name **ActiveX**. This reflects the *initial* working title of the project during its early design phase.  
> As the concept evolved and the scope expanded, it's refined the idea into what is now **Durnibar**.  
> The prototype serves as a first-version snapshot of the productâ€™s design thinking and user experience direction, prior to its current iteration.
